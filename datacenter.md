# DataCenter Exercises:

## E.Datacenter.2
Data center: Appling Data Center, Memphis, TN.

Year of inaugaration: 2004

IT load: 1500 KW

Cost per kWh in TN: 11.36 cents = $0.1136

Estimated Total Cost per Year: 1500 * 0.1136 * 24 * 365 = $1.49M

Carbon foot print: 1500 * 24 * 365 *4.61  = 7726 tons, this has been added to the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=0)

Equivalent Cars: 1703

## E.Datacenter.3
My carbon footprint has been calculated using the [carbon foot print ](http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/) calculator and added to the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=314181983).

Apparently the more people live in a house changes carbon footprint a lot more than expected. 

## E.Datacenter.4
Hydro energy: Hydro energy is generated by converting energy generated from flowing water near dams.

a)	Hydro energy produced in US by the end of 2018 is nearly 79,893 megawatts (MW) or 79.89 gigawatts (GW).

b)	Data Centers powered by hydro energy are listed below:

	• Apple – Maiden, North Carolina, USA
	• Green Mountain -  Schneider Electric owned data center in Norway
	• Facebook – Lulea in Sweden
	• Datadock – Strasbourg in France
	
## E.Datacenter.5

Although China is outpacing US in renewable energy, most of the data centers  in China rely about 75% of their power consumption on traditional sources like coal.  Whereas US datacenters are quickly moving to renewable energy sources for power consumption. For example, all of Apple's datacenters in the US are currently running on renewable energy since 2013. 

a)	In US:

•	Out of total energy produced in US, 17.1% from renewable energy sources. 

•	Among renewable energy, the main sources were 7% hydropower, 6.6% wind, and 1.6% solar power.

b)  In China:

•	Out of total energy consumbed by dataceters in China, about 25% from renewable energy sources. 

•	Among renewable energy, the main sources were 20% hydropower, 4% wind, and 1.84% solar power.


## E.Datacenter.8:

•	Data Centers effected by outages approximately: 33.33%(2018), 25%(2017) & 22%(2016)

•   I'm a frequent user of Amazon for online shopping, which internally uses AWS as its hosting infrastructure. The AWS outage on Amazon Prime Day sale in 2018 for 63 minutes 
	is estimated to have caused a loss of $100 million. A 4 hour outage in 2017 affected websites like Coursera, Medium, Quora, Docker, Expedia, and US Financial services companies
	lost around $160 million. An outage of 6 hours in 2015 caused downtime for Netflix, IMDB, Reddit, and a few more websites. The affected services were  Amazon CloudWatch, AppStream, 
	CloudSearch, Cognito, EC2 Cloud, EC2 Containers, Elastic Load Balancing, Elastic MapReduce, Elastic Transcoder, ElastiCache, Glacier, Kinesis, Machine Learning, to name a few
